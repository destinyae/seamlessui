# Welcome to the SeamlessUI Contributing Guide

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to SeamlessUI! This guide provides an overview of our contribution workflow, ensuring an effective process for all contributors.

## About the Project

SeamlessUI is a minimal, forkable repository offering beautifully designed, accessible UI components and templates for decentralized applications (dApps) on Starknet.

For an overview of the project, please refer to the [README](README.md).

### Vision

We aim to simplify building accessible, functional, and beautiful components in the web3 space. SeamlessUI ensures you don't have to repeatedly build common components, allowing for faster and more efficient dApp development.

### Project Status

The project is actively under development. You can check out the open Issues, follow the development process, and contribute to the project's growth.

## Getting started

There are many ways to contribute to SeamlessUI:

- Solve open issues

- Report bugs or feature requests

- Improve the documentation

Contributions are made via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). Here are some general guidelines:

- Before creating a new issue, check for existing Issues and PRs.

- Contributions should address either functionality or style, but not both in the same PR.

- If reporting an error, provide detailed context, such as what you were trying to do and steps to reproduce the error.

- Follow the formatting specified in the [style-guide.md](style-guide.md).

- Update the README.md file if relevant to your changes.

### Issues

Issues are used to report bugs, request features, or discuss potential changes before submitting a PR.

#### Solve an issue

Explore our [existing issues](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/issues) to find one that interests you. If you want to work on an issue, express your interest, and it may be assigned to you.

#### Create a new issue

If no related issue exists, you can create a new one. Follow these tips for writing a good issue:

- Provide detailed context to give clarity to the reader
- Include steps to reproduce the issue or the reasons for adding the feature.
- Screenshots, videos, or other media are appreciated.

### Pull Requests

#### Pull Request Process

We follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr). Here's how to submit a PR:

1. Fork the repo

2. Clone the project

3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name

4. Commit your changes following the commit conventions in [style-guide.md](style-guide.md).

5. Push changes to your fork

6. Open a PR in our repository and tag a maintainer for review.

Here are some tips for a successful PR:

- Ensure the title accurately reflects the changes made.

- Organize the description. Use bullet points and screenshots where appropriate.

- Link to the relevant issue, if applicable.

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages summarizing your changes.

#### Once you submit a PR:

- We may ask questions, request additional details, or suggest changes before merging. These are intended to maintain clarity and a smooth collaboration process.

- As you make changes, resolve any comments and mark conversations as resolved.

Once your PR is approved, we will "squash-and-merge" to maintain a clean commit history.
